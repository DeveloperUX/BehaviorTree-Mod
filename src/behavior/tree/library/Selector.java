/**
 * This parent task selects one of it's children to update.
 * 
 * To select a child, it starts from the beginning of it's children vector
 * and goes one by one until it finds one that passes the CheckCondition test.
 * It then updates that child until it finished.
 * If the child finishes with failure, it continues down the list looking another
 * candidate to update, and if it doesn't find it, it finishes with failure. 
 * If the child finishes with success, the Selector considers it's task done and 
 * bails with success.
