@ Leaf nodes are primitive behaviors ("throw grenade").
@ Internal nodes are abstract behaviors ("attack").
@ Be careful with “state-like” behaviors that keep running.
@ A Node with a "Precondition" that fails will not run nor have its children run.
@ A Behavior can have a "priority" method to tell the system which behavior to run.
@ Branches made up of Composite Nodes and Conditions, and Actions sit in the leaf nodes.
@ Currently have Selectors and Sequences, try to create Random Selectors and Priority Selectors
	@ Can do this using TaskDecorator, look at "ChanceDecorator" for an example
